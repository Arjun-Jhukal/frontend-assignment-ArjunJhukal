In order to run this program on your local device follow the guidelines given below:

2. Now run **Yarn Install** this will create a node modules in your local file
3. Now run **Yarn Dev**

The Project satisfy all the basic requirement provided by the organization.
My Idea about this project:

1. My primary focus was to work with what i know rather than learning anything new as there is a limited time.
2. I have fetched only 6 item at Landing page as landing page contains few products.
3. Secondaly i have fetched all the product while the page change to listing page
4. If any page with no url is searched i have page 404 to respond with proper styling.
5. On clicking on any product it will be added to cart and the total amount will be calculated
